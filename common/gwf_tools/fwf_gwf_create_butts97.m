% This waveform is a split version of the Wong et al. 1995 design, which
% makes it easier to balance and can be run in a non-self-balanced mode.
% Note that this design was later used by Moffat et al. 2004 without

% g  is the maximal gradient amplitude in T/m
% s  is the slew rate in T/m/s
% d  is the duration of the pulse group in s
% dp is the duration of the pause in s
% dt is the time step size in s
% If no input, create example gwf at approximately b2000 and 80 mT/m.
