% This TDE is a development of Pattern I, but not the same as what was
% suggested in the Mori paper. Instead, this modification is to only use 
% three bipolar pairs and split the middle one across the 180.
% To avoid issues with concomitant gradients, the first and last bipolar
% pairs must be in the xy-plane and the middle pair must be along z.

% g  is the maximal gradient amplitude in T/m
% s  is the slew rate in T/m/s
% d  is the duration of the pulse group in s
% dp is the duration of the pause in s
% dt is the time step size in s
% If no input, create example gwf at approximately b2000 and 80 mT/m.
